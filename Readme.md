# Branch is a version control system

## Simple workflow for commits

To manage what modifications to commit, track or untrack files.
By default, changes to tracked files are committed, but flags
make it simple to alter the list of files that are committed.

## Separate branches

Branches contain your working modifications so you can transition
between them without worrying about incompatible uncommitted changes.


## An approachable command-line interface

Branch commands will provide you with useful feedback and assist you in determining your next steps.

## Suitable for Git

You can always rely on Git because Branch is built on top of Git.
And your coworkers with whom you share a repository need not be aware of your lack of Git expertise.
Additionally, Gitless is compatible with GitHub and other Git hosting services.
